<p>We have seen that Lean's formal foundation includes basic types,
<code>Prop, Type 0, Type 1, Type 2, ...</code>, and allows for the formation of
dependent function types, <code>(x : α) → β</code>. In the examples, we have
also made use of additional types like <code>Bool</code>, <code>Nat</code>, and <code>Int</code>,
and type constructors, like <code>List</code>, and product, <code>×</code>. In fact, in
Lean's library, every concrete type other than the universes and every
type constructor other than dependent arrows is an instance of a general family of
type constructions known as <em>inductive types</em>. It is remarkable that
it is possible to construct a substantial edifice of mathematics based
on nothing more than the type universes, dependent arrow types, and inductive
types; everything else follows from those.</p>
<p>Intuitively, an inductive type is built up from a specified list of
constructors. In Lean, the syntax for specifying such a type is as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>    inductive Foo where
      | constructor₁ : ... → Foo
      | constructor₂ : ... → Foo
      ...
      | constructorₙ : ... → Foo
</code></pre>
<p>The intuition is that each constructor specifies a way of building new
objects of <code>Foo</code>, possibly from previously constructed values. The
type <code>Foo</code> consists of nothing more than the objects that are
constructed in this way. The first character <code>|</code> in an inductive
declaration is optional. We can also separate constructors using a
comma instead of <code>|</code>.</p>
<p>We will see below that the arguments of the constructors can include
objects of type <code>Foo</code>, subject to a certain &quot;positivity&quot; constraint,
which guarantees that elements of <code>Foo</code> are built from the bottom
up. Roughly speaking, each <code>...</code> can be any arrow type constructed from
<code>Foo</code> and previously defined types, in which <code>Foo</code> appears, if at
all, only as the &quot;target&quot; of the dependent arrow type.</p>
<p>We will provide a number of examples of inductive types. We will also
consider slight generalizations of the scheme above, to mutually
defined inductive types, and so-called <em>inductive families</em>.</p>
<p>As with the logical connectives, every inductive type comes with
introduction rules, which show how to construct an element of the
type, and elimination rules, which show how to &quot;use&quot; an element of the
type in another construction. The analogy to the logical connectives
should not come as a surprise; as we will see below, they, too, are
examples of inductive type constructions. You have already seen the
introduction rules for an inductive type: they are just the
constructors that are specified in the definition of the type. The
elimination rules provide for a principle of recursion on the type,
which includes, as a special case, a principle of induction as well.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will describe Lean's function definition
package, which provides even more convenient ways to define functions
on inductive types and carry out inductive proofs. But because the
notion of an inductive type is so fundamental, we feel it is important
to start with a low-level, hands-on understanding. We will start with
some basic examples of inductive types, and work our way up to more
elaborate and complex examples.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#enumerated-types" id="enumerated-types">Enumerated Types</a></h2>
<p>The simplest kind of inductive type is simply a type with a finite, enumerated list of elements.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">inductive Weekday where

  | tuesday : Weekday
  | wednesday : Weekday
  | thursday : Weekday
  | friday : Weekday
  | saturday : Weekday
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>inductive</code> command creates a new type, <code>Weekday</code>. The
constructors all live in the <code>Weekday</code> namespace.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">inductive Weekday where

<p>You can omit <code>: Weekday</code> when declaring the <code>Weekday</code> inductive type.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">inductive Weekday where
  | sunday
  | monday
  | tuesday
  | wednesday
  | thursday
  | friday
  | saturday
</code></pre>
<p>Think of <code>sunday</code>, <code>monday</code>, ... , <code>saturday</code> as
being distinct elements of <code>Weekday</code>, with no other distinguishing
properties. The elimination principle, <code>Weekday.rec</code>, is defined
along with the type <code>Weekday</code> and its constructors. It is also known
as a <em>recursor</em>, and it is what makes the type &quot;inductive&quot;: it allows
us to define a function on <code>Weekday</code> by assigning values
corresponding to each constructor. The intuition is that an inductive
type is exhaustively generated by the constructors, and has no
elements beyond those they construct.</p>
<p>We will use the <code>match</code> expression to define a function from <code>Weekday</code>
to the natural numbers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">inductive Weekday where
</span><span class="boring"> | sunday : Weekday

<p>Note that the <code>match</code> expression is compiled using the <em>recursor</em> <code>Weekday.rec</code> generated when
you declare the inductive type.</p>

<p>When declaring an inductive datatype, you can use <code>deriving Repr</code> to instruct
Lean to generate a fuction that converts <code>Weekday</code> objects into text.
This function is used by the <code>#eval</code> command to display <code>Weekday</code> objects.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">inductive Weekday where

</code></pre>
<p>It is often useful to group definitions and theorems related to a
structure in a namespace with the same name. For example, we can put
the <code>numberOfDay</code> function in the <code>Weekday</code> namespace. We are
then allowed to use the shorter name when we open the namespace.</p>
<p>We can define functions from <code>Weekday</code> to <code>Weekday</code>:</p>

<p>How can we prove the general theorem that <code>next (previous d) = d</code>
for any Weekday <code>d</code>? You can use <code>match</code> to provide a proof of the claim for each

<p><a href="#_tactics_for_inductive_types">Tactics for Inductive Types</a> below will introduce additional
tactics that are specifically designed to make use of inductive types.</p>
<p>Notice that, under the propositions-as-types correspondence, we can
use <code>match</code> to prove theorems as well as define functions.  In other
words, under the propositions-as-types correspondence, the proof by
cases is a kind of definition by cases, where what is being &quot;defined&quot;
is a proof instead of a piece of data.</p>
<p>The <code>Bool</code> type in the Lean library is an instance of
enumerated type.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>inductive Bool where
  | false : Bool
  | true  : Bool
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>(To run these examples, we put them in a namespace called <code>Hidden</code>,
so that a name like <code>Bool</code> does not conflict with the <code>Bool</code> in
the standard library. This is necessary because these types are part
of the Lean &quot;prelude&quot; that is automatically imported when the system
is started.)</p>
<p>As an exercise, you should think about what the introduction and
elimination rules for these types do. As a further exercise, we
suggest defining boolean operations <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code> on the
<code>Bool</code> type, and verifying common identities. Note that you can define a
binary operation like <code>and</code> using <code>match</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>def and (a b : Bool) : Bool :=
  match a with
  | true  =&gt; b
  | false =&gt; false
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>Similarly, most identities can be proved by introducing suitable <code>match</code>, and then using <code>rfl</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#constructors-with-arguments" id="constructors-with-arguments">Constructors with Arguments</a></h2>
<p>Enumerated types are a very special case of inductive types, in which
the constructors take no arguments at all. In general, a
&quot;construction&quot; can depend on data, which is then represented in the
constructed argument. Consider the definitions of the product type and
sum type in the library:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>inductive Prod (α : Type u) (β : Type v)
  | mk : α → β → Prod α β

inductive Sum (α : Type u) (β : Type v) where
  | inl : α → Sum α β
  | inr : β → Sum α β
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice that we do not include the types <code>α</code> and <code>β</code> in the target
of the constructors. In the meanwhile, think about what is going on in
these examples. The product type has one constructor, <code>Prod.mk</code>,
which takes two arguments. To define a function on <code>Prod α β</code>, we
can assume the input is of the form <code>Prod.mk a b</code>, and we have to
specify the output, in terms of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. We can use this to
define the two projections for <code>Prod</code>. Remember that the standard
library defines notation <code>α × β</code> for <code>Prod α β</code> and <code>(a, b)</code> for
<code>Prod.mk a b</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span><span class="boring">inductive Prod (α : Type u) (β : Type v)
</span><span class="boring">  | mk : α → β → Prod α β
</span>def fst {α : Type u} {β : Type v} (p : Prod α β) : α :=
  match p with
  | Prod.mk a b =&gt; a

def snd {α : Type u} {β : Type v} (p : Prod α β) : β :=
  match p with
  | Prod.mk a b =&gt; b
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>The function <code>fst</code> takes a pair, <code>p</code>. The <code>match</code> interprets
<code>p</code> as a pair, <code>Prod.mk a b</code>. Recall also from <a href="./dependent_type_theory.html">Dependent Type Theory</a>
that to give these definitions the greatest generality possible, we allow
the types <code>α</code> and <code>β</code> to belong to any universe.</p>
<p>Here is another example where we use the recursor <code>Prod.casesOn</code> instead
of <code>match</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">def prod_example (p : Bool × Nat) : Nat :=
  Prod.casesOn (motive := fun _ =&gt; Nat) p (fun b n =&gt; cond b (2 * n) (2 * n + 1))

#eval prod_example (true, 3)
#eval prod_example (false, 3)
</code></pre>
<p>The argument <code>motive</code> is used to specify the type of the object you want to
construct, and it is a function because it may depend on the pair.
The <code>cond</code> function is a boolean conditional: <code>cond b t1 t2</code>
returns <code>t1</code> if <code>b</code> is true, and <code>t2</code> otherwise.
The function <code>prod_example</code> takes a pair consisting of a boolean,
<code>b</code>, and a number, <code>n</code>, and returns either <code>2 * n</code> or <code>2 * n + 1</code>
according to whether <code>b</code> is true or false.</p>
<p>In contrast, the sum type has <em>two</em> constructors, <code>inl</code> and <code>inr</code>
(for &quot;insert left&quot; and &quot;insert right&quot;), each of which takes <em>one</em>
(explicit) argument. To define a function on <code>Sum α β</code>, we have to
handle two cases: either the input is of the form <code>inl a</code>, in which
case we have to specify an output value in terms of <code>a</code>, or the
input is of the form <code>inr b</code>, in which case we have to specify an
output value in terms of <code>b</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">def sum_example (s : Sum Nat Nat) : Nat :=
Sum.casesOn (motive := fun _ =&gt; Nat) s
   (fun n =&gt; 2 * n)
   (fun n =&gt; 2 * n + 1)

#eval sum_example (Sum.inl 3)
#eval sum_example (Sum.inr 3)
</code></pre>
<p>This example is similar to the previous one, but now an input to
<code>sum_example</code> is implicitly either of the form <code>inl n</code> or <code>inr n</code>.
In the first case, the function returns <code>2 * n</code>, and the second
case, it returns <code>2 * n + 1</code>.</p>
<p>Notice that the product type depends on parameters <code>α β : Type</code>
which are arguments to the constructors as well as <code>Prod</code>. Lean
detects when these arguments can be inferred from later arguments to a
constructor or the return type, and makes them implicit in that case.</p>
<p>In the section after next we will see what happens when the
constructor of an inductive type takes arguments from the inductive
type itself. What characterizes the examples we consider in this
section is that this is not the case: each constructor relies only on
previously specified types.</p>
<p>Notice that a type with multiple constructors is disjunctive: an
element of <code>Sum α β</code> is either of the form <code>inl a</code> <em>or</em> of the
form <code>inl b</code>. A constructor with multiple arguments introduces
conjunctive information: from an element <code>Prod.mk a b</code> of
<code>Prod α β</code> we can extract <code>a</code> <em>and</em> <code>b</code>. An arbitrary inductive type can
include both features, by having any number of constructors, each of
which takes any number of arguments.</p>
<p>As with function definitions, Lean's inductive definition syntax will
let you put named arguments to the constructors before the colon:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>inductive Prod (α : Type u) (β : Type v) where
  | mk (fst : α) (snd : β) : Prod α β

inductive Sum (α : Type u) (β : Type v) where
  | inl (a : α) : Sum α β
  | inr (b : β) : Sum α β
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>The results of these definitions are essentially the same as the ones given earlier in this section.</p>
<p>A type, like <code>Prod</code>, that has only one constructor is purely
conjunctive: the constructor simply packs the list of arguments into a
single piece of data, essentially a tuple where the type of subsequent
arguments can depend on the type of the initial argument. We can also
think of such a type as a &quot;record&quot; or a &quot;structure&quot;. In Lean, the
keyword <code>structure</code> can be used to define such an inductive type as
well as its projections, at the same time.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>structure Prod (α : Type u) (β : Type v) where
  mk :: (fst : α) (snd : β)
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>This example simultaneously introduces the inductive type, <code>Prod</code>,
its constructor, <code>mk</code>, the usual eliminators (<code>rec</code> and
<code>recOn</code>), as well as the projections, <code>fst</code> and <code>snd</code>, as
defined above.</p>
<p>If you do not name the constructor, Lean uses <code>mk</code> as a default. For
example, the following defines a record to store a color as a triple
of RGB values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">structure Color where
  (red : Nat) (green : Nat) (blue : Nat)
  deriving Repr

def yellow := Color.mk 255 255 0

#eval Color.red yellow
</code></pre>
<p>The definition of <code>yellow</code> forms the record with the three values
shown, and the projection <code>Color.red</code> returns the red component.</p>
<p>You can avoid the parentheses if you add a line break between each field.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">structure Color where
  red : Nat
  green : Nat
  blue : Nat
  deriving Repr
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>structure</code> command is especially useful for defining algebraic
structures, and Lean provides substantial infrastructure to support
working with them. Here, for example, is the definition of a
semigroup:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">structure Semigroup where
  carrier : Type u
  mul : carrier → carrier → carrier
  mul_assoc : ∀ a b c, mul (mul a b) c = mul a (mul b c)
</code></pre>
<p>We will see more examples in <a href="./structures_and_records.html">Chapter Structures and Records</a>.</p>
<p>We have already discussed the dependent product type <code>Sigma</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>inductive Sigma {α : Type u} (β : α → Type v) where
  | mk : (a : α) → β a → Sigma β
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>Two more examples of inductive types in the library are the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>inductive Option (α : Type u) where
  | none : Option α
  | some : α → Option α

inductive Inhabited (α : Type u) where
  | mk : α → Inhabited α
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>In the semantics of dependent type theory, there is no built-in notion
of a partial function. Every element of a function type <code>α → β</code> or a
dependent function type <code>(a : α) → β</code> is assumed to have a value
at every input. The <code>Option</code> type provides a way of representing partial functions. An
element of <code>Option β</code> is either <code>none</code> or of the form <code>some b</code>,
for some value <code>b : β</code>. Thus we can think of an element <code>f</code> of the
type <code>α → Option β</code> as being a partial function from <code>α</code> to <code>β</code>:
for every <code>a : α</code>, <code>f a</code> either returns <code>none</code>, indicating the
<code>f a</code> is &quot;undefined&quot;, or <code>some b</code>.</p>
<p>An element of <code>Inhabited α</code> is simply a witness to the fact that
there is an element of <code>α</code>. Later, we will see that <code>Inhabited</code> is
an example of a <em>type class</em> in Lean: Lean can be instructed that
suitable base types are inhabited, and can automatically infer that
other constructed types are inhabited on that basis.</p>
<p>As exercises, we encourage you to develop a notion of composition for
partial functions from <code>α</code> to <code>β</code> and <code>β</code> to <code>γ</code>, and show
that it behaves as expected. We also encourage you to show that
<code>Bool</code> and <code>Nat</code> are inhabited, that the product of two inhabited
types is inhabited, and that the type of functions to an inhabited
type is inhabited.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#inductively-defined-propositions" id="inductively-defined-propositions">Inductively Defined Propositions</a></h2>
<p>Inductively defined types can live in any type universe, including the
bottom-most one, <code>Prop</code>. In fact, this is exactly how the logical
connectives are defined.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>inductive False : Prop

inductive True : Prop where
  | intro : True

inductive And (a b : Prop) : Prop where
  | intro : a → b → And a b

inductive Or (a b : Prop) : Prop where
  | inl : a → Or a b
  | inr : b → Or a b
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>You should think about how these give rise to the introduction and
elimination rules that you have already seen. There are rules that
govern what the eliminator of an inductive type can eliminate <em>to</em>,
that is, what kinds of types can be the target of a recursor. Roughly
speaking, what characterizes inductive types in <code>Prop</code> is that one
can only eliminate to other types in <code>Prop</code>. This is consistent with
the understanding that if <code>p : Prop</code>, an element <code>hp : p</code> carries
no data. There is a small exception to this rule, however, which we
will discuss below, in the section on inductive families.</p>
<p>Even the existential quantifier is inductively defined:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>inductive Exists {α : Type u} (q : α → Prop) : Prop where
  | intro : ∀ (a : α), q a → Exists q
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind that the notation <code>∃ x : α, p</code> is syntactic sugar for <code>Exists (fun x : α =&gt; p)</code>.</p>
<p>The definitions of <code>False</code>, <code>True</code>, <code>And</code>, and <code>Or</code> are
perfectly analogous to the definitions of <code>Empty</code>, <code>Unit</code>,
<code>Prod</code>, and <code>Sum</code>. The difference is that the first group yields
elements of <code>Prop</code>, and the second yields elements of <code>Type u</code> for
some <code>u</code>. In a similar way, <code>∃ x : α, p</code> is a <code>Prop</code>-valued
variant of <code>Σ x : α, p</code>.</p>
<p>This is a good place to mention another inductive type, denoted
<code>{x : α // p}</code>, which is sort of a hybrid between
<code>∃ x : α, P</code> and <code>Σ x : α, P</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>inductive Subtype {α : Type u} (p : α → Prop) where
  | mk : (x : α) → p x → Subtype p
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>In fact, in Lean, <code>Subtype</code> is defined using the structure command:</p>
<p>The notation <code>{x : α // p x}</code> is syntactic sugar for <code>Subtype (fun x : α =&gt; p x)</code>.
It is modeled after subset notation in set theory: the idea is that <code>{x : α // p x}</code>
denotes the collection of elements of <code>α</code> that have property <code>p</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#defining-the-natural-numbers" id="defining-the-natural-numbers">Defining the Natural Numbers</a></h2>
<p>The inductively defined types we have seen so far are &quot;flat&quot;:
constructors wrap data and insert it into a type, and the
corresponding recursor unpacks the data and acts on it. Things get
much more interesting when the constructors act on elements of the
very type being defined. A canonical example is the type <code>Nat</code> of
natural numbers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>inductive Nat where
  | zero : Nat
  | succ : Nat → Nat
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>There are two constructors. We start with <code>zero : Nat</code>; it takes
no arguments, so we have it from the start. In contrast, the
constructor <code>succ</code> can only be applied to a previously constructed
<code>Nat</code>. Applying it to <code>zero</code> yields <code>succ zero : Nat</code>. Applying
it again yields <code>succ (succ zero) : Nat</code>, and so on. Intuitively,
<code>Nat</code> is the &quot;smallest&quot; type with these constructors, meaning that
it is exhaustively (and freely) generated by starting with <code>zero</code>
and applying <code>succ</code> repeatedly.</p>
<p>As before, the recursor for <code>Nat</code> is designed to define a dependent
function <code>f</code> from <code>Nat</code> to any domain, that is, an element <code>f</code>
of <code>(n : nat) → motive n</code> for some <code>motive : Nat → Sort u</code>.
It has to handle two cases: the case where the input is <code>zero</code>, and the case where
the input is of the form <code>succ n</code> for some <code>n : Nat</code>. In the first
case, we simply specify a target value with the appropriate type, as
before. In the second case, however, the recursor can assume that a
value of <code>f</code> at <code>n</code> has already been computed. As a result, the
next argument to the recursor specifies a value for <code>f (succ n)</code> in
terms of <code>n</code> and <code>f n</code>. If we check the type of the recursor,</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span><span class="boring">inductive Nat where
</span><span class="boring"> | zero : Nat
</span><span class="boring"> | succ : Nat → Nat
</span>#check @Nat.rec
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>you find the following:</p>
<pre><code>  {motive : Nat → Sort u}
  → motive Nat.zero
  → ((n : Nat) → motive n → motive (Nat.succ n))
  → (t : Nat) → motive t
</code></pre>
<p>The implicit argument, <code>motive</code>, is the codomain of the function being defined.
In type theory it is common to say <code>motive</code> is the <em>motive</em> for the elimination/recursion,
since it describes the kind of object we wish to construct.
The next two arguments specify how to compute the zero and successor cases, as described above.
They are also known as the <code>minor premises</code>.
Finally, the <code>t : Nat</code>, is the input to the function. It is also known as the <code>major premise</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Nat.recOn</code> is similar to <code>Nat.rec</code> but the major premise occurs before the minor premises.</p>
<pre><code>@Nat.recOn :
  {motive : Nat → Sort u}
  → (t : Nat)
  → motive Nat.zero
  → ((n : Nat) → motive n → motive (Nat.succ n))
  → motive t
</code></pre>
<p>Consider, for example, the addition function <code>add m n</code> on the
natural numbers. Fixing <code>m</code>, we can define addition by recursion on
<code>n</code>. In the base case, we set <code>add m zero</code> to <code>m</code>. In the
successor step, assuming the value <code>add m n</code> is already determined,
we define <code>add m (succ n)</code> to be <code>succ (add m n)</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden

  | Nat.succ n =&gt; Nat.succ (add m n)

open Nat

#eval add (succ (succ zero)) (succ zero)
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>It is useful to put such definitions into a namespace, <code>Nat</code>. We can
then go on to define familiar notation in that namespace. The two
defining equations for addition now hold definitionally:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden

theorem add_zero (m : Nat) : m + zero = m := rfl
theorem add_succ (m n : Nat) : m + succ n = succ (m + n) := rfl

end Nat
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>We will explain how the <code>instance</code> command works in
<a href="./type_classes.html">Chapter Type Classes</a>. In the examples below, we will henceforth use
Lean's version of the natural numbers.</p>
<p>Proving a fact like <code>zero + m = m</code>, however, requires a proof by induction.
As observed above, the induction principle is just a special case of the recursion principle,
when the codomain <code>motive n</code> is an element of <code>Prop</code>. It represents the familiar
pattern of an inductive proof: to prove <code>∀ n, motive n</code>, first prove <code>motive 0</code>,
and then, for arbitrary <code>n</code>, assume <code>ih : motive n</code> and prove <code>motive (succ n)</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>open Nat

theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n :=
  Nat.recOn (motive := fun x =&gt; 0 + x = x)
   n

   (fun (n : Nat) (ih : 0 + n = n) =&gt;
    show 0 + succ n = succ n from

                _ = succ n       := by rw [ih])
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice that, once again, when <code>Nat.recOn</code> is used in the context of
a proof, it is really the induction principle in disguise. The
<code>rewrite</code> and <code>simp</code> tactics tend to be very effective in proofs
like these. In this case, each can be used to reduce the proof to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>open Nat

theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n :=
  Nat.recOn (motive := fun x =&gt; 0 + x = x) n
    rfl
    (fun n ih =&gt; by simp [add_succ, ih])
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>For another example, let us prove the associativity of addition,
<code>∀ m n k, m + n + k = m + (n + k)</code>.
(The notation <code>+</code>, as we have defined it, associates to the left, so <code>m + n + k</code> is really <code>(m + n) + k</code>.)
The hardest part is figuring out which variable to do the induction on. Since addition is defined by recursion on the second argument,
<code>k</code> is a good guess, and once we make that choice the proof almost writes itself:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>open Nat
theorem add_assoc (m n k : Nat) : m + n + k = m + (n + k) :=
  Nat.recOn (motive := fun k =&gt; m + n + k = m + (n + k)) k
    (show m + n + 0 = m + (n + 0) from rfl)
    (fun k (ih : m + n + k = m + (n + k)) =&gt;
      show m + n + succ k = m + (n + succ k) from
      calc
          m + n + succ k = succ (m + n + k) := rfl
            _ = succ (m + (n + k)) := by rw [ih]
            _ = m + succ (n + k) := rfl
            _ = m + (n + succ k) := rfl)
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>One again, you can reduce the proof to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">open Nat
theorem add_assoc (m n k : Nat) : m + n + k = m + (n + k) :=
  Nat.recOn (motive := fun k =&gt; m + n + k = m + (n + k)) k
    rfl
    (fun k ih =&gt; by simp [Nat.add_succ, ih]; done)
</code></pre>
<p>Suppose we try to prove the commutativity of addition. Choosing induction on the second argument, we might begin as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">open Nat
theorem add_comm (m n : Nat) : m + n = n + m :=
  Nat.recOn (motive := fun x =&gt; m + x = x + m) n
   (show m + 0 = 0 + m by rw [Nat.zero_add, Nat.add_zero])
   (fun (n : Nat) (ih : m + n = n + m) =&gt;
    show m + succ n = succ n + m from
    calc m + succ n = succ (m + n) := rfl
                  _ = succ (n + m) := by rw [ih]
                  _ = succ n +  m  := sorry)
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, we see that we need another supporting fact, namely, that <code>succ (n + m) = succ n + m</code>.
You can prove this by induction on <code>m</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">open Nat

theorem succ_add (n m : Nat) : succ n + m = succ (n + m) :=
  Nat.recOn (motive := fun x =&gt; succ n + x = succ (n + x)) m

    (fun (m : Nat) (ih : succ n + m = succ (n + m)) =&gt;
     show succ n + succ m = succ (n + succ m) from
     calc succ n + succ m = succ (succ n + m) := rfl
           _  = succ (succ (n + m))           := by rw [ih]
           _  = succ (n + succ m)             := rfl)

<p>Given the fundamental importance of inductive types in Lean, it should
not be surprising that there are a number of tactics designed to work
with them effectively. We describe some of them here.</p>
<p>The <code>cases</code> tactic works on elements of an inductively defined type,
and does what the name suggests: it decomposes the element according
to each of the possible constructors. In its most basic form, it is
applied to an element <code>x</code> in the local context. It then reduces the
goal to cases in which <code>x</code> is replaced by each of the constructions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">example (p : Nat → Prop) (hz : p 0) (hs : ∀ n, p (Nat.succ n)) : ∀ n, p n := by
  intro n
  cases n
  . exact hz  -- goal is p 0
  . apply hs  -- goal is a : ℕ ⊢ p (succ a)
</code></pre>
<p>There are extra bells and whistles. For one thing, <code>cases</code> allows
you to choose the names for each alternative using a
<code>with</code> clause. In the next example, for example, we choose the name
<code>m</code> for the argument to <code>succ</code>, so that the second case refers to
<code>succ m</code>. More importantly, the cases tactic will detect any items
in the local context that depend on the target variable. It reverts
these elements, does the split, and reintroduces them. In the example
below, notice that the hypothesis <code>h : n ≠ 0</code> becomes <code>h : 0 ≠ 0</code>
in the first branch, and <code>h : succ m ≠ 0</code> in the second.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">open Nat

example (n : Nat) (h : n ≠ 0) : succ (pred n) = n := by
  cases n with
  | zero =&gt;
    -- goal: h : 0 ≠ 0 ⊢ succ (pred 0) = 0
    apply absurd rfl h
  | succ m =&gt;
    -- second goal: h : succ m ≠ 0 ⊢ succ (pred (succ m)) = succ m
    rfl
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that <code>cases</code> can be used to produce data as well as prove propositions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">def f (n : Nat) : Nat := by
  cases n; exact 3; exact 7

example : f 0 = 3 := rfl
example : f 5 = 7 := rfl
</code></pre>
<p>Once again, cases will revert, split, and then reintroduce depedencies in the context.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">def Tuple (α : Type) (n : Nat) :=
  { as : List α // as.length = n }

def f {n : Nat} (t : Tuple α n) : Nat := by
  cases n; exact 3; exact 7

def myTuple : Tuple Nat 3 :=
  ⟨[0, 1, 2], rfl⟩

example : f myTuple = 7 :=
  rfl
</code></pre>
<p>Here is an example with multiple constructors with arguments.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">inductive Foo where
  | bar1 : Nat → Nat → Foo
  | bar2 : Nat → Nat → Nat → Foo

def silly (x : Foo) : Nat := by
  cases x with
  | bar1 a b =&gt; exact b
  | bar2 c d e =&gt; exact e
</code></pre>
<p>The alternatives for each constructor don't need to be solved
in the order the constructors were declared.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">inductive Foo where
  | bar1 : Nat → Nat → Foo
  | bar2 : Nat → Nat → Nat → Foo

def silly (x : Foo) : Nat := by
  cases x with
  | bar2 c d e =&gt; exact e
  | bar1 a b =&gt; exact b
</code></pre>
<p>The syntax of the <code>with</code> is convenient for writing structured proofs.
Lean also provides a complementary <code>case</code> tactic, which allows you to focus on goal
assign variable names.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">inductive Foo where
  | bar1 : Nat → Nat → Foo
  | bar2 : Nat → Nat → Nat → Foo

def silly (x : Foo) : Nat := by
  cases x
  case bar2 c d e =&gt; exact e
  case bar1 a b =&gt; exact b
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>case</code> tactic is clever, in that it will match the constructor to the appropriate goal. For example, we can fill the goals above in the opposite order:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">inductive Foo where
  | bar1 : Nat → Nat → Foo
  | bar2 : Nat → Nat → Nat → Foo

def silly (x : Foo) : Nat := by
  cases x
  case bar1 a b =&gt; exact b
  case bar2 c d e =&gt; exact e
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use <code>cases</code> with an arbitrary expression. Assuming that
expression occurs in the goal, the cases tactic will generalize over
the expression, introduce the resulting universally quantified
variable, and case on that.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">open Nat

example (p : Nat → Prop) (hz : p 0) (hs : ∀ n, p (succ n)) (m k : Nat)
        : p (m + 3 * k) := by
  cases m + 3 * k
  exact hz   -- goal is p 0
  apply hs   -- goal is a : ℕ ⊢ p (succ a)
</code></pre>
<p>Think of this as saying &quot;split on cases as to whether <code>m + 3 * k</code> is
zero or the successor of some number.&quot; The result is functionally
equivalent to the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">open Nat

example (p : Nat → Prop) (hz : p 0) (hs : ∀ n, p (succ n)) (m k : Nat)
        : p (m + 3 * k) := by
  generalize m + 3 * k = n
  cases n
  exact hz   -- goal is p 0
  apply hs   -- goal is a : ℕ ⊢ p (succ a)
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the expression <code>m + 3 * k</code> is erased by <code>generalize</code>; all
that matters is whether it is of the form <code>0</code> or <code>succ a</code>. This
form of <code>cases</code> will <em>not</em> revert any hypotheses that also mention
the expression in the equation (in this case, <code>m + 3 * k</code>). If such a
term appears in a hypothesis and you want to generalize over that as
well, you need to <code>revert</code> it explicitly.</p>
<p>If the expression you case on does not appear in the goal, the
<code>cases</code> tactic uses <code>have</code> to put the type of the expression into
the context. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">example (p : Prop) (m n : Nat)
        (h₁ : m &lt; n → p) (h₂ : m ≥ n → p) : p := by
  cases Nat.lt_or_ge m n
  case inl hlt =&gt; exact h₁ hlt
  case inr hge =&gt; exact h₂ hge
</code></pre>
<p>The theorem <code>Nat.lt_or_ge m n</code> says <code>m &lt; n ∨ m ≥ n</code>, and it is
natural to think of the proof above as splitting on these two
cases. In the first branch, we have the hypothesis <code>h₁ : m &lt; n</code>, and
in the second we have the hypothesis <code>h₂ : m ≥ n</code>. The proof above
is functionally equivalent to the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">example (p : Prop) (m n : Nat)
        (h₁ : m &lt; n → p) (h₂ : m ≥ n → p) : p := by
  have h : m &lt; n ∨ m ≥ n := Nat.lt_or_ge m n
  cases h
  case inl hlt =&gt; exact h₁ hlt
  case inr hge =&gt; exact h₂ hge
</code></pre>
<p>After the first two lines, we have <code>h : m &lt; n ∨ m ≥ n</code> as a
hypothesis, and we simply do cases on that.</p>
<p>Here is another example, where we use the decidability of equality on
the natural numbers to split on the cases <code>m = n</code> and <code>m ≠ n</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">#check Nat.sub_self

example (m n : Nat) : m - n = 0 ∨ m ≠ n := by
  cases Decidable.em (m = n) with
  | inl heq =&gt; rw [heq]; apply Or.inl; exact Nat.sub_self n
  | inr hne =&gt; apply Or.inr; exact hne
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that if you <code>open Classical</code>, you can use the law of the
excluded middle for any proposition at all. But using type class
inference (see <a href="./type_classes.html">Chapter Type Classes</a>), Lean can actually
find the relevant decision procedure, which means that you can use the
case split in a computable function.</p>
<p>Just as the <code>cases</code> tactic can be used to carry out proof by cases,
the <code>induction</code> tactic can be used to carry out proofs by
induction. The syntax is similar to that of <code>cases</code>, except that the
argument can only be a term in the local context. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero =&gt; rfl
  | succ n ih =&gt; rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>As with <code>cases</code>, we can use the <code>case</code> tactic instead of <code>with</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n
  case zero =&gt; rfl
  case succ n ih =&gt; rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>Here are some additional examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>open Nat

theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n &lt;;&gt; simp [*, add_zero, add_succ]

theorem succ_add (m n : Nat) : succ m + n = succ (m + n) := by
  induction n &lt;;&gt; simp [*, add_zero, add_succ]

theorem add_comm (m n : Nat) : m + n = n + m := by

  induction k &lt;;&gt; simp [*, add_zero, add_succ]
<span class="boring">end Hidden

<p>The <code>induction</code> tactic also supports user-defined induction principles with
multiple targets (aka major premises).</p>

       rw [← Nat.mod_eq_of_lt hgt] at hgt

<p>You can use the <code>match</code> notation in tactics too:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">example : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by

<p>As a convenience, pattern-matching has been integrated into tactics such as <code>intro</code> and <code>funext</code>.</p>

  intro ⟨_, ⟨hq, _⟩⟩ ⟨hp, _⟩

  funext (a, b) (c, d)
  show a + d = d + a
  rw [Nat.add_comm]
</code></pre>
<p>We close this section with one last tactic that is designed to
facilitate working with inductive types, namely, the <code>injection</code>
tactic. By design, the elements of an inductive type are freely
generated, which is to say, the constructors are injective and have
disjoint ranges. The <code>injection</code> tactic is designed to make use of
this fact:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">open Nat

example (m n k : Nat) (h : succ (succ m) = succ (succ n))
        : n + k = m + k := by
  injection h with h'
  injection h' with h''
  rw [h'']
</code></pre>
<p>The first instance of the tactic adds <code>h' : succ m = succ n</code> to the
context, and the second adds <code>h'' : m = n</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>injection</code> tactic also detects contradictions that arise when different constructors
are set equal to one another, and uses them to close the goal.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">open Nat


example (m n : Nat) (h : succ m = 0) : n = n + 7 := by
  injection h

example (m n : Nat) (h : succ m = 0) : n = n + 7 := by
  contradiction

example (h : 7 = 4) : False := by
  contradiction
</code></pre>
<p>As the second example shows, the <code>contradiction</code> tactic also detects contradictions of this form.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#inductive-families" id="inductive-families">Inductive Families</a></h2>
<p>We are almost done describing the full range of inductive definitions
accepted by Lean. So far, you have seen that Lean allows you to
introduce inductive types with any number of recursive
constructors. In fact, a single inductive definition can introduce an
indexed <em>family</em> of inductive types, in a manner we now describe.</p>
<p>An inductive family is an indexed family of types defined by a
simultaneous induction of the following form:</p>
<pre><code>inductive foo : ... → Sort u where
  | constructor₁ : ... → foo ...
  | constructor₂ : ... → foo ...
  ...
  | constructorₙ : ... → foo ...
</code></pre>
<p>In contrast to ordinary inductive definition, which constructs an
element of some <code>Sort u</code>, the more general version constructs a
function <code>... → Sort u</code>, where &quot;<code>...</code>&quot; denotes a sequence of
argument types, also known as <em>indices</em>. Each constructor then
constructs an element of some member of the family. One example is the
definition of <code>Vector α n</code>, the type of vectors of elements of <code>α</code>
of length <code>n</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>inductive Vector (α : Type u) : Nat → Type u where
  | nil  : Vector α 0
  | cons : α → {n : Nat} → Vector α n → Vector α (n+1)
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice that the <code>cons</code> constructor takes an element of
<code>Vector α n</code> and returns an element of <code>Vector α (n+1)</code>, thereby using an
element of one member of the family to build an element of another.</p>
<p>A more exotic example is given by the definition of the equality type in Lean:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>inductive Eq {α : Sort u} (a : α) : α → Prop where
  | refl {} : Eq a a
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>For each fixed <code>α : Sort u</code> and <code>a : α</code>, this definition
constructs a family of types <code>Eq a x</code>, indexed by <code>x : α</code>.
Notably, however, there is only one constructor, <code>refl</code>, which
is an element of <code>Eq a a</code>, and the curly braces after the
constructor tell Lean to make the argument to <code>refl</code>
explicit. Intuitively, the only way to construct a proof of <code>Eq a x</code>
is to use reflexivity, in the case where <code>x</code> is <code>a</code>.
Note that <code>Eq a a</code> is the only inhabited type in the family of types
<code>Eq a x</code>. The elimination principle generated by Lean is as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">universe u v

#check (@Eq.rec : {α : Sort u} → {a : α} → {motive : (x : α) → a = x → Sort v}
                  → motive a rfl → {b : α} → (h : a = b) → motive b h)
</code></pre>
<p>It is a remarkable fact that all the basic axioms for equality follow
from the constructor, <code>refl</code>, and the eliminator, <code>Eq.rec</code>. The
definition of equality is atypical, however; see the discussion in the
next section.</p>
<p>The recursor <code>Eq.rec</code> is also used to define substitution:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>theorem subst {α : Type u} {a b : α} {p : α → Prop} (h₁ : Eq a b) (h₂ : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.rec (motive := fun x _ =&gt; p x) h₂ h₁
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>You can also define <code>subst</code> using <code>match</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>theorem subst {α : Type u} {a b : α} {p : α → Prop} (h₁ : Eq a b) (h₂ : p a) : p b :=
  match h₁ with
  | rfl =&gt; h₂
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>Actually, Lean compiles the <code>match</code> expressions using a definition based on
<code>Eq.rec</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>theorem subst {α : Type u} {a b : α} {p : α → Prop} (h₁ : Eq a b) (h₂ : p a) : p b :=
  match h₁ with
  | rfl =&gt; h₂

set_option pp.all true
#print subst
  -- ... subst.match_1 ...
#print subst.match_1
  -- ... Eq.casesOn ...
#print Eq.casesOn
  -- ... Eq.rec ...
<span class="boring">end Hidden
</span></code></pre>
<p>Using the recursor or <code>match</code> with <code>h₁ : a = b</code>, we may assume <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are the same,
in which case, <code>p b</code> and <code>p a</code> are the same.</p>
<p>It is not hard to prove that <code>Eq</code> is symmetric and transitive.
In the following example, we prove <code>symm</code> and leave as exercise the theorems <code>trans</code> and <code>congr</code> (congruence).</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean"><span class="boring">namespace Hidden
</span>theorem symm {α : Type u} {a b : α} (h : Eq a b) : Eq b a :=

<p>In the type theory literature, there are further generalizations of
inductive definitions, for example, the principles of
<em>induction-recursion</em> and <em>induction-induction</em>. These are not
supported by Lean.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#axiomatic-details" id="axiomatic-details">Axiomatic Details</a></h2>
<p>We have described inductive types and their syntax through
examples. This section provides additional information for those
interested in the axiomatic foundations.</p>
<p>We have seen that the constructor to an inductive type takes
<em>parameters</em> --- intuitively, the arguments that remain fixed
throughout the inductive construction --- and <em>indices</em>, the arguments
parameterizing the family of types that is simultaneously under
construction. Each constructor should have a type, where the
argument types are built up from previously defined types, the
parameter and index types, and the inductive family currently being
defined. The requirement is that if the latter is present at all, it
occurs only <em>strictly positively</em>. This means simply that any argument
to the constructor in which it occurs is a dependent arrow type in which the
inductive type under definition occurs only as the resulting type,
where the indices are given in terms of constants and previous
arguments.</p>
<p>Since an inductive type lives in <code>Sort u</code> for some <code>u</code>, it is
reasonable to ask <em>which</em> universe levels <code>u</code> can be instantiated
to. Each constructor <code>c</code> in the definition of a family <code>C</code> of
inductive types is of the form</p>
<pre><code>  c : (a : α) → (b : β[a]) → C a p[a,b]
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>a</code> is a sequence of data type parameters, <code>b</code> is the
sequence of arguments to the constructors, and <code>p[a, b]</code> are the
indices, which determine which element of the inductive family the
construction inhabits. (Note that this description is somewhat
misleading, in that the arguments to the constructor can appear in any
order as long as the dependencies make sense.) The constraints on the
universe level of <code>C</code> fall into two cases, depending on whether or
not the inductive type is specified to land in <code>Prop</code> (that is,
<code>Sort 0</code>).</p>
<p>Let us first consider the case where the inductive type is <em>not</em>
specified to land in <code>Prop</code>. Then the universe level <code>u</code> is
constrained to satisfy the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For each constructor <code>c</code> as above, and each <code>βk[a]</code> in the sequence <code>β[a]</code>, if <code>βk[a] : Sort v</code>, we have <code>u</code> ≥ <code>v</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the universe level <code>u</code> is required to be at least as
large as the universe level of each type that represents an argument
to a constructor.</p>
<p>When the inductive type is specified to land in <code>Prop</code>, there are no
constraints on the universe levels of the constructor arguments. But
these universe levels do have a bearing on the elimination
rule. Generally speaking, for an inductive type in <code>Prop</code>, the
motive of the elimination rule is required to be in <code>Prop</code>.</p>
<p>There is an exception to this last rule: we are allowed to eliminate
from an inductively defined <code>Prop</code> to an arbitrary <code>Sort</code> when
there is only one constructor and each constructor argument is either
in <code>Prop</code> or an index. The intuition is that in this case the
elimination does not make use of any information that is not already
given by the mere fact that the type of argument is inhabited. This
special case is known as <em>singleton elimination</em>.</p>
<p>We have already seen singleton elimination at play in applications of
<code>Eq.rec</code>, the eliminator for the inductively defined equality
type. We can use an element <code>h : Eq a b</code> to cast an element
<code>t' : p a</code> to <code>p b</code> even when <code>p a</code> and <code>p b</code> are arbitrary types,
because the cast does not produce new data; it only reinterprets the
data we already have. Singleton elimination is also used with

<p>We now consider two generalizations of inductive types that are often
useful, which Lean supports by &quot;compiling&quot; them down to the more
primitive kinds of inductive types described above. In other words,
Lean parses the more general definitions, defines auxiliary inductive
types based on them, and then uses the auxiliary types to define the
ones we really want. Lean's equation compiler, described in the next
chapter, is needed to make use of these types
effectively. Nonetheless, it makes sense to describe the declarations
here, because they are straightforward variations on ordinary
inductive definitions.</p>
<p>First, Lean supports <em>mutually defined</em> inductive types. The idea is
that we can define two (or more) inductive types at the same time,
where each one refers to the other(s).</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">mutual
  inductive Even : Nat → Prop where
    | even_zero : Even 0
    | even_succ : (n : Nat) → Odd n → Even (n + 1)

  inductive Odd : Nat → Prop where
    | odd_succ : (n : Nat) → Even n → Odd (n + 1)
end
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, two types are defined simultaneously: a natural
number <code>n</code> is <code>Even</code> if it is <code>0</code> or one more than an <code>Odd</code>
number, and <code>Odd</code> if it is one more than an <code>Even</code> number.
In the exercises below, you are asked to spell out the details.</p>
<p>A mutual inductive definition can also be used to define the notation
of a finite tree with nodes labelled by elements of <code>α</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">mutual
    inductive Tree (α : Type u) where
      | node : α → TreeList α → Tree α

    inductive TreeList (α : Type u) where
      | nil  : TreeList α
      | cons : Tree α → TreeList α → TreeList α
end
</code></pre>
<p>With this definition, one can construct an element of <code>Tree α</code> by
giving an element of <code>α</code> together with a list of subtrees, possibly
empty. The list of subtrees is represented by the type <code>TreeList α</code>,
which is defined to be either the empty list, <code>nil</code>, or the
<code>cons</code> of a tree and an element of <code>TreeList α</code>.</p>
<p>This definition is inconvenient to work with, however. It would be
much nicer if the list of subtrees were given by the type
<code>List (Tree α)</code>, especially since Lean's library contains a number of functions
and theorems for working with lists. One can show that the type
<code>TreeList α</code> is <em>isomorphic</em> to <code>List (Tree α)</code>, but translating
results back and forth along this isomorphism is tedious.</p>
<p>In fact, Lean allows us to define the inductive type we really want:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">inductive Tree (α : Type u) where
  | mk : α → List (Tree α) → Tree α
</code></pre>
<p>This is known as a <em>nested</em> inductive type. It falls outside the
strict specification of an inductive type given in the last section
because <code>Tree</code> does not occur strictly positively among the
arguments to <code>mk</code>, but, rather, nested inside the <code>List</code> type
constructor. Lean then automatically builds the
isomorphism between <code>TreeList α</code> and <code>List (Tree α)</code> in its kernel,
and defines the constructors for <code>Tree</code> in terms of the isomorphism.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Try defining other operations on the natural numbers, such as
multiplication, the predecessor function (with <code>pred 0 = 0</code>),
truncated subtraction (with <code>n - m = 0</code> when <code>m</code> is greater
than or equal to <code>n</code>), and exponentiation. Then try proving some
of their basic properties, building on the theorems we have already
proved.</p>
<p>Since many of these are already defined in Lean's core library, you
should work within a namespace named <code>Hidden</code>, or something like
that, in order to avoid name clashes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define some operations on lists, like a <code>length</code> function or the
<code>reverse</code> function. Prove some properties, such as the following:</p>
<p>a. <code>length (s ++ t) = length s + length t</code></p>
<p>b. <code>length (reverse t) = length t</code></p>
<p>c. <code>reverse (reverse t) = t</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define an inductive data type consisting of terms built up from the following constructors:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>const n</code>, a constant denoting the natural number <code>n</code></li>
<li><code>var n</code>, a variable, numbered <code>n</code></li>
<li><code>plus s t</code>, denoting the sum of <code>s</code> and <code>t</code></li>
<li><code>times s t</code>, denoting the product of <code>s</code> and <code>t</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Recursively define a function that evaluates any such term with respect to an assignment of values to the variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, define the type of propositional formulas, as well as
functions on the type of such formulas: an evaluation function,
functions that measure the complexity of a formula, and a function
that substitutes another formula for a given variable.</p>
</li>
